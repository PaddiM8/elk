# Editor Support

Integrations exist for Vim, Neovim and Visual Studio Code. The Neovim and Visual Studio code plugins
both connect to the Elk language server, which provides semantic highlighting, intellisense, and more.

## Visual Studio Code

The Visual Studio Code plugin is available on the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PaddiM8.elk-shell).

## Vim/Neovim

A copy of the Vim plugin is pushed to the repository [PaddiM8/elk-vim](https://github.com/PaddiM8/elk-vim)
when releases are made. Clone the repository into `<vim directory>/pack/packages/start/elk`.
